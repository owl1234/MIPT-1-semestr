This project implements code translation to uneven bytecode, disassembly tool for generated bytecode, and bytecode executor (Soft Processor Unit).

# Syntax
## General commands
### push <value>
Push value to stack
Types of argument:
1. push <register> (e.g. push rcx)
2. push <number> (e.g. push 6)
3. push <[register]> (e.g. push [rax] - push value that is in memory at the address rax) 
4. push <[number]> (e.g. push [8] - push value that is in memory at the address 8) 
5. push <[register + number]> (e.g. push [rdx + 12] - push value that is in memory at the address rdx + 12) 

### pop <nothing/register>
Pop value from stack
1. pop without arguments - top of stack is not saved anywhere 
2. pop <register> (e.g. pop rax - top of stack saved into rax)

### in
Request value from the console

### out
Prints value to the console

### hlt
Finish the program  <br />
   <br />
   
   
  
## Math commands
### add number1, number2
Takes two numbers from the stack - the top one and the next one after the top one, adds them and pushes the result onto the stack

### sub number1, number2
Takes two numbers from the stack - the top one and the next after the top one, subtracts first from the second and pushes the result onto the stack.

### mul number1, number2
Takes two numbers from the stack - the top one and the next one after the top one, multiplicates them and pushes the result onto the stack

### div number1, number2
Takes two numbers from the stack - the top one and the next after the top one, divides first from the second and pushes the result onto the stack.

### sqrt
Extracts the square root of the top of the stack and puts it on the stack.
