We want to differentiate this expression:
$$ x+5*arcctg(ln(6*y)) $$
\section{\Large{Differentiation}}
This expression is quite complex. Let's try to differentiate it piece by piece: 
$$ (x+5*arcctg(ln(6*y)))'$$
Variable is fairly easy to work with when differentiating: 
$$ x' = 1 $$
This expression is quite complex. Let's try to differentiate it piece by piece: 
$$ (5*arcctg(ln(6*y)))'$$
Derivatives of a number are easy! Look at it: 
$$ 5' = 0 $$
This expression is quite complex. Let's try to differentiate it piece by piece: 
$$ (arcctg(ln(6*y)))'$$
This expression is quite complex. Let's try to differentiate it piece by piece: 
$$ (ln(6*y))'$$
This expression is quite complex. Let's try to differentiate it piece by piece: 
$$ (6*y)'$$
Derivatives of a number are easy! Look at it: 
$$ 6' = 0 $$
Variable is fairly easy to work with when differentiating: 
$$ y' = 1 $$
Come back to our expression: 
$$ (6*y)' = 
(6*1+y*0) $$
Come back to our expression: 
$$ (ln(6*y))' = 
\frac{1}{6*y}*6*1+y*0 $$
Come back to our expression: 
$$ (arcctg(ln(6*y)))' = 
\frac{(-1)}{1+(ln(6*y))^{2}}*\frac{1}{6*y}*(6*1+y*0) $$
Come back to our expression: 
$$ (5*arcctg(ln(6*y)))' = 
(5*\frac{(-1)}{1+(ln(6*y))^{2}}*\frac{1}{6*y}*(6*1+y*0)+arcctg(ln(6*y))*0) $$
Come back to our expression: 
$$ (x+5*arcctg(ln(6*y)))' = 
(1+5*\frac{(-1)}{1+(ln(6*y))^{2}}*\frac{1}{6*y}*6*1+y*0+arcctg(ln(6*y))*0) $$
Result:
$$ 1+(5*\frac{(-1)}{1+(ln(6*y))^{2}}*\frac{1}{6*y}*(6*1+y*0)+arcctg(ln(6*y))*0) $$
\section{\Large{Simplification after differentiation}}$$ 1+(5*\frac{(-1)}{1+(ln(6*y))^{2}}*\frac{1}{6*y}*(6*1+y*0)+arcctg(ln(6*y))*0) $$
