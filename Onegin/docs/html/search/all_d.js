Nay, he will answer the letter &apos;s master, how he dares, being Ben. No, coz, I rather weep. Ben. Not to his father &apos;s. I spoke with his man. Ben. O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio &apos;s dead! Ben. O noble Prince. I can discover all Ben. Of love? Ben. Part, fools![Beats down their swords.] Ben. Romeo will answer it. Ben. Romeo! my cousin Romeo! Romeo! Ben. Romeo, away, be gone! Ben. See, where he comes. So please you step aside, Ben. She will endite him to some supper. Ben. Soft! I will go along. Ben. Stop there, stop there! Ben. Strike, drum. Ben. Tell me in sadness, who is that you love? Ben. The date is out of such prolixity. Ben. The what? Ben. Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste? Ben. There lies that Tybalt. Ben. This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves. Ben. Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large. Ben. Tut! you saw her fair, none else being by, Ben. Tut, man, one fire burns out another &apos;s burning;Ben. Two, two! a shirt and a smock. Ben. Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo &apos;s hand did stay. Ben. Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet, Ben. We talk here in the public haunt of men. Ben. What, art thou hurt? Ben. Why dost thou stay? Ben. Why, Romeo, art thou mad? Ben. Why, what is Tybalt? Beshrew your heart for sending me about Betroth &apos;d and would have married her perforce Black and portentous must this humour prove Blind is his love and best befits the dark. Blubb &apos;ring and weeping, weeping and blubbering. Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud;Both you and I, for Romeo is exil &apos;d. Brags of his substance, not of ornament. Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe. Bring forth the parties of suspicion. But I will watch you from such watching now. But I will write again to Mantua, But I &apos;ll amerce you with so strong a fine But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed. But O, it presses to my memory But Romeo may not- he is banished. But Romeo may not. More validity, But Romeo &apos;s name speaks heavenly eloquence. But a hare that is hoar But all so soon as the all-cheering sun But &apos;banished&apos; to kill me- &apos;banished&apos;? But by-and-by comes back to Romeo, But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger But come, young waverer, come go with me. But every man betake him to his legs. But fettle your fine joints &apos;gainst Thursday next But for the sunset of my brother &apos;s son But he that hath the steerage of my course But he which bore my letter, Friar John, But he, his own affections&apos; counsellor, But heaven keeps his part in eternal life. But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry But in that crystal scales let there be weigh &apos;d But look thou stay not till the watch be set, But love from love, towards school with heavy looks.[Retiring.] But love thee better than thou canst devise But much of grief shows still some want of wit. But my true love is grown to such excess But no more deep will I endart mine eye But not another sin upon my head But not possess &apos;d it;and though I am sold, But now I see this one is one too much, But now I &apos;ll tell thee joyful tidings, girl. But now, my lord, what say you to my suit? But old folks, many feign as they were dead- But one thing to rejoice and solace in, But one, poor one, one poor and loving child, But passion lends them power, time means, to meet, But purgatory, torture, hell itself. But sadly tell me who. But send him back. But she &apos;s best married that dies married young. But soft! What light through yonder window breaks? But thankful even for hate that is meant love. But that thou overheard &apos;st, ere I was ware, But the true ground of all these piteous woes But then a noise did scare me from the tomb, But thou shalt hear it. Whistle then to me, But thou slewest Tybalt. There art thou happy too. But &apos;tis no wit to go. But to himself so secret and so close, But to his foe suppos &apos;d he must complain, But to rejoice in splendour of my own. But to the earth some special good doth give;But trust me, gentleman, I &apos;ll prove more true But when I came, some minute ere the time But where unbruised youth with unstuff &apos;d brain But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin? But with a rearward following Tybalt &apos;s death, But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart;But you shall bear the burthen soon at night. But, an you will not wed, I &apos;ll pardon you. But, as it seems, did violence on herself. But, let them measure us by what they will, But, like a misbhav &apos;d and sullen wench, But, soft! what day is this? By any other name would smell as sweet. By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown! By doing damned hate upon thyself? By having him making yourself no less. By heaven, I love thee better than myself, By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh, By her high forehead and her scarlet lip, By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here By holy marriage. When, and where, and how By leaving earth? Comfort me, counsel me. By one that I &apos;ll procure to come to thee, By playing it to me with so sour a face. By some vile forfeit of untimely death. By thee, old Capulet, and Montague, By their own beauties;or, if love be blind, By urging me to fury. O, be gone! CAPULET &apos;S house. CAPULET &apos;S house. CAPULET &apos;S house.

You are looke &apos;t for and call &apos;d for, ask &apos;t for and sought Five times in that ere once in our five wits. Flower as she was, deflowered by him. Fly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone;For I am proverb &apos;d with a grandsire phrase, For I am sure you have your hands full all For I come hither arm &apos;d against myself. For I had then laid wormwood to my dug, For I have need of many orisons For I ne &apos;er saw true beauty till this night. For I will raise her Statue in pure gold, For Juliet &apos;s sake, for her sake, rise and stand! For Venus smiles not in a house of tears. For beauty, starv &apos;d with her severity, For blood of ours shed blood of Montague. For even the day before, she broke her brow;For exile hath more terror in his look, For fair without the fair within to hide. For fear of that I still will stay with thee For hark you, Tybalt being slain so late, For he hath still been tried a holy man. For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes For here we need it not. For in a minute there are many days. For it excels your first;or if it did not, For it was bad enough before their spite. For men so old as we to keep the peace. For naught so vile that on the earth doth live For never was a story of more woe For nothing can be ill if she be well. For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring. For saints have hands that pilgrims&apos; hands do touch, For so he said he would. I hear him near. For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea, For stony limits cannot hold love out, For such a wish! He was not born to shame. For sweet discourses in our time to come. For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night. For then I hope thou wilt not keep him long For then she could stand high-lone;nay, by th&apos; rood, For then thou canst not pass to Mantua, For this alliance may so happy prove For this night &apos;s watching. For this time all the rest depart away. For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night For though fond nature bids us all lament, For &apos;tis a throne where honour may be crown &apos;d For &apos;twas your heaven she should be advanc &apos;d;For well you know this is a pitiful case.[Exit.] For who is living, if those two are gone? For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin &apos;d. For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead. For you and I are past our dancing days.

Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast, Had I it written, I would tear the word. Had part in this fair maid! now heaven hath all, Had she affections and warm youthful blood, Hadst thou no poison mix &apos;d, no sharp-ground knife, Haply some poison yet doth hang on them Happiness courts thee in her best array;Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night. Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away. Hast thou no letters to me from the friar? Hast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself? Hath Death lain with thy wife. See, there she lies, Hath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but &apos;I,&apos; Hath been my kinsman. O sweet Juliet, Hath had no notice of these accidents;Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty. Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye Hath sent a letter to his father &apos;s house. Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt &apos;s death Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away. Hath wash &apos;d thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline! Have at thee, coward! Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish &apos;d. Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who &apos;s there? Have they been merry! which their keepers call Have thrice disturb &apos;d the quiet of our streets Have you delivered to her our decree? Having displeas &apos;d my father, to Laurence&apos; cell, Having some business, do entreat her eyes[He goes down.] He heareth not, he stirreth not, be moveth not;He jests at scars that never felt a wound.[He leaps the orchad-wall.] He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes. He made you for a highway to my bed;He shall not make me there a joyful bride! He shift a trencher! he scrape a trencher! He swung about his head and cut the winds, He that is strucken blind cannot forget He told me Paris should have married Juliet.[He walks by them and sings.] He &apos;ll fright you up, i&apos; faith. Will it not be? Hear me with patience but to speak a word. Helen and Hero hildings and harlots, This be a gray eye or so, Help, help! Call help. Hence banished is banish &apos;d from the world, Hence will I to my ghostly father &apos;s cell, Henceforth I never will be Romeo. Henceforward I am ever rul &apos;d by you. Henceforward do your messages yourself. Her Nurse is privy;and if aught in this Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;Her body sleeps in Capel &apos;s monument, Her chariot is an empty hazelnut, Her collars, of the moonshine &apos;s wat &apos;ry beams;Her eye discourses;I will answer it. Her mother is the lady of the house.

I am no pilot;yet, wert thou as far I am not I, if there be such an &apos;I&apos;;I am the drudge, and toil in your delight;I am too bold; &apos;tis not to me she speaks. I am too young, I pray you pardon me&apos;! I bade her come. What, lamb! what ladybird! I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo, I beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give. I bring thee tidings of the Prince &apos;s doom. I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet, I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe. I cannot choose but ever weep the friend. I charge thee in the Prince &apos;s name obey. I come from Lady Juliet. I conjure only but to raise up him. I conjure thee by Rosaline &apos;s bright eyes. I do beseech thee- I do remember an apothecary, I do remember well where I should be, I dreamt my lady came and found me dead I dreamt my master and another fought, I drew to part them. In the instant came I fear it is;and yet methinks it should not, I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins I have an interest in your hate &apos;s proceeding, I have been feasting with mine enemy, I have forgot that name, and that name &apos;s woe. I have forgot why I did call thee back. I have more care to stay than will to go. I have no joy of this contract to-night. I have rememb &apos;red me, thou &apos;s hear our counsel. I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu! I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it, I know not how to tell thee who I am. I married them;and their stol &apos;n marriage day I must be gone and live, or stay and die. I must hear from thee every day in the hour, I must needs wake you. Lady! lady! lady! I must up-fill this osier cage of ours I needs must wake her. Madam, madam, madam! I never should forget it. &apos;Wilt thou not, Jule?&apos; quoth he, I nurs &apos;d her daughter that you talk &apos;d withal. I pray thee leave me to myself to-night;I pray you tell my lord and father, madam, I promise you, but for your company, I saw her laid low in her kindred &apos;s vault I sell thee poison;thou hast sold me none. I should have been more strange, I must confess, I tell thee what- get thee to church a Thursday I tell you, he that can lay hold of her I thank you, honest gentlemen. Good night. I think it best you married with the County. I think you are happy in this second match, I thought thy disposition better temper &apos;d. I wake before the time that Romeo I warrant, an I should live a thousand yeas, I was your mother much upon these years I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;I will carry no crotchets. I &apos;ll re you, I &apos;ll fa you. Do you note I will not budge for no man &apos;s pleasure, I. I will not entertain so bad a thought. I will not marry yet;and when I do, I swear I will omit no opportunity I will withdraw;but this intrusion shall, I wonder at this haste, that I must wed I would adventure for such merchandise. I would have been abed an hour ago. I would not for the wealth of all this town I would say thou hadst suck &apos;d wisdom from thy teat. I would the fool were married to her grave! I &apos;ll be a candle-holder and look on;I &apos;ll bury thee in a triumphant grave. I &apos;ll call them back again to comfort me. I &apos;ll find those that shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his I &apos;ll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay, I &apos;ll go and chat with Paris. Hie, make haste, I &apos;ll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning. I &apos;ll know his grievance, or be much denied. I &apos;ll make you quiet;what!- Cheerly, my hearts! I &apos;ll not endure him. I &apos;ll not to bed to-night;let me alone. I &apos;ll play the housewife for this once. What, ho! I &apos;ll say yon grey is not the morning &apos;s eye, I &apos;ll tell thee as we pass;but this I pray, I &apos;ll to him;he is hid at Laurence&apos; cell. I &apos;ll to my rest. I &apos;ll to the friar to know his remedy. I &apos;ll warrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any clout I- measuring his affections by my own, If I departed not and left him there. If I did stay to look on his intents. If I profane with my unworthiest hand If all else fail, myself have power to die. If any of my kinsmen find thee here. If be be slain, say &apos;I&apos;;or if not, &apos;no.&apos; If e &apos;er thou wast thyself, and these woes thine, If ever you disturb our streets again, If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help, If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear If that thy bent of love be honourable, If thou art Dun, we &apos;ll draw thee from the mire If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him If thou art taken. Hence, be gone, away! If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully. If what thou speak &apos;st speak not of remedy. If, rather than to marry County Paris Immediately we do exile him hence. In all her best array bear her to church;In all respects by me;nay more, I doubt it not. In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize In dear employment. Therefore hence, be gone. In fair Verona, where we lay our scene, In half an hour she &apos;promis &apos;d to return. In lasting labour of his pilgrimage! In man as well as herbs- grace and rude will;In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh? In my behalf- my reputation stain &apos;d In one respect I &apos;ll thy assistant be;In penalty alike;and &apos;tis not hard, I think, In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities;In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman. In shape no bigger than an agate stone In such a gorgeous palace! In tatt &apos;red weeds, with overwhelming brows, In that dim monument where Tybalt lies. In that word &apos;s death;no words can that woe sound. In the mean time, against thou shalt awake, In thee at once;which thou at once wouldst lose. In these confusions. Heaven and yourself In this resolve. I &apos;ll send a friar with speed In this so sudden business. In thy best robes uncovered on the bier In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond, In what I farther shall intend to do, In what vile part of this anatomy Inherit at my house. Hear all, all see, Is Romeo slaught &apos;red, and is Tybalt dead? Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear, Is but a little way above our heads, Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks, Is death misterm &apos;d. Calling death &apos;banishment,&apos; Is death to any he that utters them. Is empty on the back of Montague, Is fair and honest:in his mistress&apos; name, Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet, Is guilty of this lamentable chance? The lady stirs. Is he gone and hath nothing? Is it e &apos;en so? Why then, I thank you all. Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn, Is loathsome in his own deliciousness Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse. Is my dear son with such sour company. Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex &apos;d. Is not so long as is a tedious tale. Is now the two hours&apos; traffic of our stage;Is partly to behold my lady &apos;s face, Is she not down so late, or up so early? Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blest, Is this the poultice for my aching bones? Is three long hours;yet she is not come. Is thy news good or bad? Answer to that. Is to himself- I will not say how true- Is too much for a score Is very good meat in Lent;It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces. It best agrees with night. Come, civil night, It burneth in the Capels&apos; monument. It cannot countervail the exchange of joy It helps not, it prevails not. Talk no more. It is enough I may but call her mine. It is my lady;O, it is my love! It is my will;the which if thou respect, It is some meteor that the sun exhales It is supposed the fair creature died- It is the East, and Juliet is the sun! It is the lark that sings so out of tune, It is too rash, too unadvis &apos;d, too sudden;It may be thought we held him carelessly, It rains downright. It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate, It strains me past the compass of my wits. It was the nightingale, and not the lark, It were a grief so brief to part with thee. Italy;and as soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be JULIET rises. JULIET &apos;S chamber. JULIET &apos;S chamber. JULIET, daughter to Capulet. Jesu Maria! What a deal of brine Juiet. And joy comes well in such a needy time. Juiet. Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell. Juiet. Hist! Romeo, hist! O for a falconer &apos;s voice Juiet. Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband? Juiet. &apos;Tis but thy name that is my enemy. Jul. I have. Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye. Juliet, the County stays. Juliet. A rhyme I learnt even now Juliet. A thousand times good night![Exit JULIET above]. Juliet. Amen! Juliet. Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend! Juliet. And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I. Juliet. Art thou gone so, my lord, my love, my friend? Juliet. As much to him, else is his thanks too much. Juliet. At what o &apos;clock to-morrow Juliet. Ay me! Juliet. Ay me! what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands Juliet. Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands. Juliet. Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in pray &apos;r. Juliet. Ay, those attires are best;but, gentle nurse, Juliet. Blister &apos;d be thy tongue Juliet. But to be frank and give it thee again. Juliet. By whose direction found &apos;st thou out this place? Juliet. By-and-by I come.- Juliet. Can heaven be so envious? Juliet. Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman? Juliet. Conceit, more rich in matter than in words, Juliet. Do not swear at all;Juliet. Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again. Juliet. Feeling so the loss, Juliet. Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds, Juliet. Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear! Juliet. Go ask his name.- If he be married, Juliet. Go, get thee hence, for I will not away. Juliet. Good even to my ghostly confessor. Juliet. Good father, I beseech you on my knees, Juliet. Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Juliet. Here &apos;s such a coil! Come, what says Romeo? Juliet. How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath Juliet. How cam &apos;st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? Juliet. How now? Who calls? Juliet. I come, anon.- But if thou meanest not well, Juliet. I gave thee mine before thou didst request it;Juliet. I met the youthful lord at Laurence&apos; cell Juliet. I shall forget, to have thee still stand there, Juliet. I will confess to you that I love him. Juliet. I will not fail. &apos;Tis twenty years till then. Juliet. I would not for the world they saw thee here. Juliet. I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news. Juliet. I&apos; faith, I am sorry that thou art not well. Juliet. I &apos;ll look to like, if looking liking move;Juliet. If I do so, it will be of more price, Juliet. If they do see thee, they will murther thee. Juliet. Indeed I never shall be satisfied Juliet. Is there no pity sitting in the clouds Juliet. It is an honour that I dream not of. Juliet. It is, it is! Hie hence, be gone, away! Juliet. It may be so, for it is not mine own. Juliet. Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford. Juliet. Madam, I am here. Juliet. Madam, I am not well. Juliet. Madam, in happy time! What day is that? Juliet. My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words Juliet. My only love, sprung from my only hate! Juliet. No, madam;we have cull &apos;d such necessaries Juliet. No, no. But all this did I know before. Juliet. Not proud you have, but thankful that you have. Juliet. Now by Saint Peter &apos;s Church, and Peter too, Juliet. Now, good sweet nurse- O Lord, why look &apos;st thou sad? Juliet. Nurse, will you go with me into my closet Juliet. Nurse? Juliet. O Fortune, Fortune! all men call thee fickle. Juliet. O God! Did Romeo &apos;s hand shed Tybalt &apos;s blood? Juliet. O God!- O nurse, how shall this be prevented? Juliet. O God, I have an ill-divining soul! Juliet. O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? Juliet. O comfortable Friar! where is my lord? Juliet. O serpent heart, hid with a flow &apos;ring face! Juliet. O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris, Juliet. O, break, my heart! poor bankrout, break at once! Juliet. O, find him! give this ring to my true knight Juliet. O, shut the door! and when thou hast done so, Juliet. O, swear not by the moon, th&apos; inconstant moon, Juliet. O, think &apos;st thou we shall ever meet again? Juliet. Romeo! Juliet. Saints do not move, though grant for prayers&apos; sake. Juliet. Speak &apos;st thou this from thy heart? Juliet. Sweet, so would I. Juliet. Tell me not, friar, that thou hear &apos;st of this, Juliet. That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;Juliet. That may be, sir, when I may be a wife. Juliet. The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;Juliet. The tears have got small victory by that, Juliet. Then have my lips the sin that they have took. Juliet. Then, window, let day in, and let life out. Juliet. Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face;Juliet. Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. Juliet. &apos;Tis almost morning. I would have thee gone- Juliet. To answer that, I should confess to you. Juliet. Wash they his wounds with tears? Mine shall be spent, Juliet. Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee, Juliet. Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much. Juliet. What devil art thou that dost torment me thus? Juliet. What man art thou that, thus bescreen &apos;d in night, Juliet. What must be shall be. Juliet. What satisfaction canst thou have to-night? Juliet. What storm is this that blows so contrary? Juliet. What villain, madam? Juliet. What &apos;s he that follows there, that would not dance? Juliet. What &apos;s he that now is going out of door? Juliet. Where I have learnt me to repent the sin Juliet. Where is my mother? Why, she is within. Juliet. Who is &apos;t that calls? It is my lady mother. Juliet. Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day. Juliet. Yea, noise? Then I &apos;ll be brief. O happy dagger! Juliet. Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss. Juliet. Yond light is not daylight;I know it, I. Juliet. You kiss by th&apos; book. Juliet.[aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder. Just in her case!

Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts Of a despised life, clos &apos;d in my breast, Of a poor pothecary, and therewithal Of all my buried ancestors are pack &apos;d;Of all the days of the year, upon that day;Of an old tear that is not wash &apos;d off yet. Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades, Of dear import;and the neglecting it Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep. Of disobedient opposition Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train &apos;d, Of healths five fadom deep;and then anon Of her awaking, here untimely lay Of ill-shaped fishes;and about his shelves Of limping Winter treads, even such delight Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him Of my child &apos;s love. I think she will be rul &apos;d Of my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true, Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool, Of one I danc &apos;d withal. Of some strange nature, letting it there stand Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;Of that tongue &apos;s utterance, yet I know the sound. Of this day &apos;s journey, and from nine till twelve Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick &apos;st Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight. Of yonder knight? On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen;On Thursday next be married to this County. On pain of torture, from those bloody hands On the fair daughter of rich Capulet;On the forefinger of an alderman, On the white wonder of dear Juliet &apos;s hand On this fair corse, and, as the custom is, Once more, on pain of death, all men depart. One calls within, &apos;Juliet.&apos; One desperate grief cures with another &apos;s languish. One fairer than my love? The all-seeing sun One more, most welcome, makes my number more. One nickname for her purblind son and heir, One of our order, to associate me One pain is lessoned by another &apos;s anguish;One that you love. One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, One writ with me in sour misfortune &apos;s book! Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.[PARIS dies.] Or I shall faint. A plague o&apos; both your houses! Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither. Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet Or bid me go into a new-made grave Or by the break of day disguis &apos;d from hence. Or dedicate his beauty to the sun. Or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us. Or if he do, it needs must be by stealth. Or if not so, then here I hit it right- Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won, Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Or if you do not, make the bridal bed Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both! Or in my cell there would she kill herself. Or manage it to part these men with me. Or my true heart with treacherous revolt Or never after look me in the face. Or shall I come to you at evening mass Or shall we on without apology? Or shut me nightly in a charnel house, Or those eyes shut that make thee answer &apos;I.&apos; Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk Or, if I live, is it not very like Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter. Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, Or, wanting that, with tears distill &apos;d by moans. Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.

Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable. Take him and cut him out in little stars, Take it in what sense thou wilt. Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits Take thou some new infection to thy eye, Take thou this vial, being then in bed, Take up those cords. Poor ropes, you are beguil &apos;d, Taking the measure of an unmade grave. Taking thy part, hath rush &apos;d aside the law, Temp &apos;ring extremities with extreme sweet. Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love. Than empty tigers or the roaring sea. Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice. Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell. Than this of Juliet and her Romeo. Than those that have more cunning to be strange. Than thou went &apos;st forth in lamentation. Than twenty of their swords! Look thou but sweet, Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain Than your consent gives strength to make it fly. Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds, That God had lent us but this only child;That I have worn a visor and could tell That I might touch that cheek! That I must love a loathed enemy. That I reviv &apos;d and was an emperor. That I shall say good night till it be morrow. That I will show you shining at this feast, That I yet know not? That Romeo bid thee fetch? That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof, That after-hours with sorrow chide us not! That all the world will be in love with night That almost freezes up the heat of life. That &apos;banished,&apos; that one word &apos;banished,&apos; That birds would sing and think it were not night. That book in many &apos;s eyes doth share the glory, That calls our person from our morning rest? That cop &apos;st with death himself to scape from it;That ever I should live to see thee dead! That ever ever I did yet behold! That fair for which love groan &apos;d for and would die, That gallant spirit hath aspir &apos;d the clouds, That he dares ne &apos;er come back to challenge you;That he shall soon keep Tybalt company;That he should hither come as this dire night That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love! That idles in the wanton summer air, That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;That in thy likeness thou appear to us! That is renown &apos;d for faith? Be fickle, Fortune, That late thou gavest me;for Mercutio &apos;s soul That lets it hop a little from her hand, That living mortals, hearing them, run mad- That may convey my greetings, love, to thee. That monthly changes in her circled orb, That murd &apos;red me. I would forget it fain;That murd &apos;red my love &apos;s cousin- with which grief That one short minute gives me in her sight. That pierc &apos;d the fearful hollow of thine ear. That plats the manes of horses in the night That presses them and learns them first to bear, That quench the fire of your pernicious rage That runaway eyes may wink, and Romeo That sees into the bottom of my grief? That shall she, marry;I remember it well. That she do give her sorrow so much sway, That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio. That the life-weary taker mall fall dead, That thou consent to marry us to-day. That thou expects not nor I look &apos;d not for. That thou hast done me;therefore turn and draw. That thou her maid art far more fair than she. That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops- That unsubstantial Death is amorous, That villain cousin would have kill &apos;d my husband. That warns my old age to a sepulchre. That we have had no time to move our daughter. That we may call it early by-and-by. That were some spite;my invocation That westward rooteth from the city &apos;s side, That whiles Verona by that name is known, That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:That you run mad, seeing that she is well. That you shall all repent the loss of mine. That you shall rest but little. God forgive me! That &apos;s by me wounded. Both our remedies That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store. The County Paris hath set up his rest The County Paris, at Saint Peter &apos;s Church, The County will be here with music straight, The ape is dead, and I must conjure him. The boy gives warning something doth approach. The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain. The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;The curfew bell hath rung, &apos;tis three o &apos;clock. The dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark! The day is broke;be wary, look about.[Exit.] The day is hot, the Capulets abroad. The day to cheer and night &apos;s dank dew to dry, The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she;The earth that &apos;s nature &apos;s mother is her tomb. The excuse that thou dost make in this delay The fearful passage of their death-mark &apos;d love, The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar &apos;d;The fish lives in the sea, and &apos;tis much pride The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo The gallant, young, and noble gentleman, The game was ne &apos;er so fair, and I am done. The hateful mansion. The heavens do low &apos;r upon you for some ill;The horrible conceit of death and night, The lady widow of Vitruvio;The law, that threat &apos;ned death, becomes thy friend The letter was not nice, but full of charge, The life of Tybalt. The measure done, I &apos;ll watch her place of stand The more I have, for both are infinite. The most you sought was her promotion, The noble Paris and true Romeo dead. The obsequies that I for thee will keep The only son of your great enemy. The orchard walls are high and hard to climb, The other did not so. The precious treasure of his eyesight lost. The pretty wretch left crying, and said &apos;Ay.&apos; The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade The shady curtains from Aurora &apos;s bed, The stony entrance of this sepulchre? The sun for sorrow will not show his head. The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears, The time and my intents are savage-wild, The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl. The unreasonable fury of a beast. The valiant Paris seeks you for his love. The vaulty heaven so high above our heads. The which if you with patient ears attend, The world affords no law to make thee rich;The world is not thy friend, nor the world &apos;s law;Thee here in dark to be his paramour? Their course of love, the tidings of her death;Then be not poor, but break it and take this. Then dreams he of another benefice. Then gave I her - so tutored by my art - Then is it likely thou wilt undertake Then love-devouring death do what he dare- Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair, &apos;Then music with her silver sound Then music with her silver sound&apos;- Then weep no more. I &apos;ll send to one in Mantua, Then, as the manner of our country is, Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom! Then, since the case so stands as now it doth, There art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee, There is no end, no limit, measure, bound, There lies the man, slain by young Romeo, There shall no figure at such rate be set There stays a husband to make you a wife. Therefore be patient, take no note of him. Therefore do nimble-pinion &apos;d doves draw Love, Therefore farewell. I see thou knowest me not. Therefore have done. Some grief shows much of love;Therefore love moderately:long love doth so;Therefore stay yet;thou need &apos;st not to be gone. Therefore thy earliness doth me assure Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me. Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste, Therefore we &apos;ll have some half a dozen friends, Therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn &apos;st away. Therefore, out of thy long-experienc &apos;d time, These dead men &apos;s tombs. These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old. These happy masks that kiss fair ladies&apos; brows, They are all forth;well, I will walk myself They are but beggars that can count their worth;They are free men, but I am banished.[They fight.][They fight.][They fight.][They fight.][They fight. TYBALT falls.] They have made worms&apos; meat of me. I have it, [They march about the stage and exeunt.] They pray;grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.[They retire behind]. They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo, [They whisper in his ear.] They &apos;ll be in scarlet straight at any news. Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble- Think true love acted simple modesty. This bud of love, by summer &apos;s ripening breath, This but begins the woe others must end. This dagger hath mista &apos;en, for, lo, his house This doth not so, for she divideth us. This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep. This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:This is as &apos;t should be. Let me see the County. This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not. This is my daughter &apos;s jointure, for no more This is not Romeo, he &apos;s some other where. This is she- This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, This is the truth, or let Benvolio die. This is thy sheath;there rust, and let me die. This letter he early bid me give his father, This love feel I, that feel no love in this. This may flies do, when I from this must fly;This neighbour air, and let rich music &apos;s tongue This night I hold an old accustom &apos;d feast, This night you shall behold him at our feast. This precious book of love, this unbound lover, This torture should be roar &apos;d in dismal hell. This trick may chance to scathe you. I know what. This vault a feasting presence full of light. Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain. Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline. Thou art not conquer &apos;d. Beauty &apos;s ensign yet Thou art thyself, though not a Montague. Thou art uprous &apos;d with some distemp &apos;rature;Thou counterfeit &apos;st a bark, a sea, a wind:Thou cut &apos;st my head off with a golden axe Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on Thou hast amaz &apos;d me. By my holy order, Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, Thou knowest my daughter &apos;s of a pretty age. Thou knowest my lodging. Get me ink and paper Thou mayst prove false. At lovers&apos; perjuries, Thou pout &apos;st upon thy fortune and thy love. Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault Thou shalt be loggerhead![Exit 2 Servingman.] Thou shalt continue two-and-forty hours, Thou sober-suited matron, all in black, Thou talk &apos;st of nothing. Thou wast the prettiest babe that e &apos;er I nurs &apos;d. Thou wilt be taken.- Stay awhile!- Stand up;[Knock.] Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no other Though heaven cannot. O Romeo, Romeo! Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word Through fair Verona;find those persons out Through lovers&apos; brains, and then they dream of love;Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground Thursday is near;lay hand on heart, advise:Thursday let it be, a Thursday, tell her Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open, Thus from my lips, by thine my sin is purg &apos;d.[He Kisses her.] Thy beauty hath made me effeminate Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury, Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.[He falls.] Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both, Thy fault our law calls death;but the kind Prince, Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;Thy lips are warm! Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell. Thy noble shape is but a form of wax Thy old groans ring yet in mine ancient ears. Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, Thy tears are womanish, thy wild acts denote Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife? Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love, Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels;Tickling a parson &apos;s nose as &apos;a lies asleep, Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak. Till Holy Church incorporate two in one. Till I conveniently could send to Romeo. Till she had laid it and conjur &apos;d it down. Till the Prince came, who parted either part. Till then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss.[Exit.] Till thou shalt know the reason of my love;Till we can clear these ambiguities Time out o&apos; mind the fairies&apos; coachmakers. &apos;Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia &apos;s brow; &apos;Tis now near night. &apos;Tis since the earthquake now eleven years; &apos;Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio, &apos;Tis very late;she &apos;ll not come down to-night. To County Paris, to prepare him up To County Paris. Then comes she to me To Juliet &apos;s grave;for there must I use thee. To Lammastide? To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord. To an impatient child that hath new robes To answer &apos;I &apos;ll not wed, I cannot love;To be a virtuous and well-govern &apos;d youth. To be consorted with the humorous night. To be to thee this night a torchbearer To bear a poison, I would temper it-;To beautify him only lacks a cover. To beg your pardon. Pardon, I beseech you! To bid me trudge. To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends, To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear, To call hers(exquisite) in question more. To catch my death with jauncing up and down! To cease thy suit and leave me to my grief. To comfort thee, though thou art banished. To comfort you. I wot well where he is. To cross my obsequies and true love &apos;s rite? To enter in the thoughts of desperate men! To fetch a ladder, by the which your love To fleer and scorn at our solemnity? To follow this fair corse unto her grave. To go with Paris to Saint Peter &apos;s Church, To grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern, To have her match &apos;d;and having now provided To hear good counsel. O, what learning is! To hear him nam &apos;d and cannot come to him, To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let &apos;s away. To help me after? I will kiss thy lips. To help me sort such needful ornaments To help to take her from her borrowed grave, To know our farther pleasure in this case, To lay one in, another out to have. To lie discolour &apos;d by this place of peace? To live an unstain &apos;d wife to my sweet love. To lure this tassel-gentle back again! To make confession and to be absolv &apos;d. To make me die with a restorative.[She kisses him.] To mangle me with that word &apos;banished&apos;? To marry Paris. Wednesday is to-morrow. To meet her new beloved anywhere;To merit bliss by making me despair. To move the heavens to smile upon my state, To murther, murther our solemnity? To old Freetown, our common judgment place. To paly ashes, thy eyes&apos; windows fall To press before thy father to a grave? To prison, eyes;ne &apos;er look on liberty! To raise a spirit in his mistress&apos; circle To rid her from this second marriage, To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead. To say to me that thou art out of breath? To scorn at our solemnity this night. To season love, that of it doth not taste! To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug! To see now how a jest shall come about! To see thy son and heir more early down. &apos;To seek him here that means not to be found. To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss. To soar with his light feathers;and so bound To stop the inundation of her tears, To strike him dead I hold it not a sin. To such a greeting. Villain am I none. To sunder his that was thine enemy? To the dead bodies. I will apprehend him. To think it should leave crying and say &apos;Ay.&apos; To think it was so? O, give me thy hand, To this same place, to this same monument. To turn your households&apos; rancour to pure love. To twinkle in their spheres till they return. To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in, To wield old partisans, in hands as old, To wreak the love I bore my cousin To you and your behests, and am enjoin &apos;d To-night she &apos;s mew &apos;d up to her heaviness. Together with the terror of the place- Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone;Tomorrow will I send. Too early seen unknown, and known too late! Too flattering-sweet to be substantial. Too great oppression for a tender thing. Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Too rude, too boist &apos;rous, and it pricks like thorn. Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow. Torments him so that he will sure run mad. Towards Phoebus&apos; lodging! Such a wagoner Towards him I made;but he was ware of me Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars! Trust to &apos;t. Bethink you. I &apos;ll not be forsworn. Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out. Turn from their office to black funeral- Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;Turn thee Benvolio! look upon thy death. Turn to another, this shall slay them both. Turning his face to the dew-dropping South. &apos;Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife Two households, both alike in dignity, Two may keep counsel, putting one away? Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven, Two such opposed kings encamp them still Tyb. Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries Tyb. Follow me close, for I will speak to them. Tyb. I am for you.[He draws.] Tyb. It fits when such a villain is a guest. Tyb. Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo. Tyb. Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting Tyb. Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford Tyb. This, by his voice, should be a Montague. Tyb. Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here, Tyb. &apos;Tis he, that villain Romeo. Tyb. Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe;Tyb. Well, peace be with you, sir. Here comes my man. Tyb. What wouldst thou have with me? Tyb. What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds? Tyb. What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word Tyb. Why, uncle, &apos;tis a shame. Tyb. You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you will give me &apos;Tybalt is dead, and Romeo- banished.&apos; Tybalt under Romeo &apos;s arm thrusts Mercutio in. Tybalt, Mercutio, the Prince expressly hath Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet? Tybalt, that murtherer, which way ran he? Tybalt, you ratcatcher, will you walk? Uncomfortable time, why cam &apos;st thou now Under love &apos;s heavy burthen do I sink. Under yond yew tree lay thee all along, Uneven is the course;I like it not. Unfold the imagin &apos;d happiness that both Unless good counsel may the cause remove. Unless philosophy can make a Juliet, Unless that husband send it me from heaven Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it. Unplagu &apos;d with corns will have a bout with you. Unseemly woman in a seeming man! Unto my cell. Unto the rigour of severest law. Unto the white-upturned wond &apos;ring eyes Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead. Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho! Upon a rapier &apos;s point. Stay, Tybalt, stay! Upon his body that hath slaughter &apos;d him. Upon his brow shame is asham &apos;d to sit;Upon so soft a subject as myself! Upon the sweetest flower of all the field. Utter your gravity o &apos;er a gossip &apos;s bowl, Verona. A churchyard;in it the monument of the CAPULETS. Verona. A public place. Verona. CAPULET &apos;S orchard. Verona. FRIAR LAURENCE &apos;S cell. Vile earth, to earth resign;end motion here, Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied, Waking or sleeping, still my care hath been Warm and new kill &apos;d. Was Tybalt &apos;s doomsday, whose untimely death Was ever book containing such vile matter Was stay &apos;d by accident, and yesternight Was that my father that went hence so fast? Was woe enough, if it had ended there;1. Watchman. A great suspicion! Stay the friar too. 3. Watchman. Here is a friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps. 1. Watchman. Here is a friar, and slaughter &apos;d Romeo &apos;s man, 2. Watchman. Here &apos;s Romeo &apos;s man. We found him in the churchyard. 1. Watchman. Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither. 1. Watchman. Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;1 Watchman. &apos;the ground is bloody. Search about the churchyard. Watchman.[within.] Lead, boy. Which way? We are undone, lady, we are undone! We cannot without circumstance descry. We have a trifling foolish banquet towards. We met, we woo &apos;d, and made exchange of vow, We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again;We see the ground whereon these woes do lie, We shall be much unfurnish &apos;d for this time. We sucking on her natural bosom find;We took this mattock and this spade from him We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day. We would as willingly give cure as know. We &apos;ll have no Cupid hoodwink &apos;d with a scarf, We &apos;ll keep no great ado- a friend or two;We &apos;ll measure them a measure, and be gone. Welcome from Mantua. What says Romeo? Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day Well said, my hearts!- You are a princox- go! Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night. Were in a mask? Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God;Were thinly scattered, to make up a show. Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love, What I have spoke;but farewell compliment! What are they, I beseech your ladyship? What curious eye doth quote deformities? What cursed foot wanders this way to-night What doth her beauty serve but as a note What early tongue so sweet saluteth me? What further woe conspires against mine age? What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend. What if her eyes were there, they in her head? What if it be a poison which the friar What if this mixture do not work at all? What is her burying gave, that is her womb;What is it else? A madness most discreet, What is your will? What lady &apos;s that, which doth enrich the hand What mean these masterless and gory swords What said my man when my betossed soul What say you, Simon Catling? What say &apos;st thou? Hast thou not a word of joy? What says he of our marriage? What of that? What simpleness is this.- I come, I come![Knock.] What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand What torch is yond that vainly lends his light What unaccustom &apos;d cause procures her hither? What &apos;s Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot, What &apos;s here? A cup, clos &apos;d in my true love &apos;s hand? What &apos;s in a name? That which we call a rose What, dress &apos;d, and in your clothes, and down again? What, goodman boy? I say he shall. Go to! What, have you din &apos;d at home? What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence? What, not a word? You take your pennyworths now! What, rouse thee, man! Thy Juliet is alive, What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears? What, with a torch? Muffle me, night, awhile. Whate &apos;er thou hearest or seest, stand all aloof When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it? When King Cophetua lov &apos;d the beggar maid! When but love &apos;s shadows are so rich in joy. &apos;When griping grief the heart doth wound, When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple When it hoars ere it be spent. When presently through all thy veins shall run When theirs are dry, for Romeo &apos;s banishment. When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend When well apparell &apos;d April on the heel Where I may read who pass &apos;d that passing fair? Where Juliet lives;and every cat and dog Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie. Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montage, Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth, Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. Where for this many hundred years the bones Where is my father and my mother, nurse? Where is my lady &apos;s lord, where &apos;s Romeo? Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon. Where is she? and how doth she! and what says Where is the County &apos;s page that rais &apos;d the watch? &quot;Where is your mother?&quot;&apos; Where on a sudden one hath wounded me Where serpents are;chain me with roaring bears, Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here? Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest! Where that same banish &apos;d runagate doth live, Where the infectious pestilence did reign, Where thou shalt live till we can find a time Where &apos;s Romeo &apos;s man? What can he say in this? Where, underneath the grove of sycamore Whereto I have invited many a guest, Which are the children of an idle brain, Which craves as desperate an execution Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto. Which is as thin of substance as the air, Which is the god of my idolatry, Which mannerly devotion shows in this;Which modern lamentation might have mov &apos;d? Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues, Which once untangled much misfortune bodes Which she hath prais &apos;d him with above compare Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit. Which ten times faster glide than the sun &apos;s beams Which the commission of thy years and art Which the dark night hath so discovered. Which then most sought where most might not be found, Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest Which to the high topgallant of my joy Which too untimely here did scorn the earth. Which with sweet water nightly I will dew, Which you weep for. Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy. Which, as he breath &apos;d defiance to my ears, Which, as they kiss, consume. The sweetest honey Which, but their children &apos;s end, naught could remove, Which, like a usurer, abound &apos;st in all, Which, on more view of many, mine, being one, Which, too much minded by herself alone, Which, well thou knowest, is cross and full of sin. While we were interchanging thrusts and blows, Whipp &apos;d and tormented and- God-den, good fellow. Whiter than new snow upon a raven &apos;s back. Who ever would have thought it? Romeo! Who had but newly entertain &apos;d revenge, Who here hath lain this two days buried. Who is already sick and pale with grief Who knocks so hard? Whence come you? What &apos;s your will? Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe? Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point, Who, even in pure and vestal modesty, Who, nothing hurt withal, hiss &apos;d him in scorn. Who, raging with thy tears and they with them, Whose misadventur &apos;d piteous overthrows Whose names are written there, and to them say, Whose sale is present death in Mantua, Why I descend into this bed of death Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe Why followed not, when she said &apos;Tybalt &apos;s dead,&apos; Why railest thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth? Why should you fall into so deep an O?[He rises] Why &apos;silver sound&apos;? Why &apos;music with her silver sound&apos;? Why then, O brawling love! O loving hate! Why, lamb! why, lady! Fie, you slug-abed! Why, love, I say! madam! sweetheart! Why, bride! Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;Will I set up my everlasting rest Will ne &apos;er wear out the everlasting flint. Will now deny to dance? She that makes dainty, Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts, Will watch thy waking, and that very night Will you be ready? Do you like this haste? Will you go to them? I will bring you thither. Wilt thou not, Jule?&apos; It stinted, and said &apos;Ay.&apos; Wilt thou not, Jule?&apos; and, by my holidam, With Cupid &apos;s arrow. She hath Dian &apos;s wit, With Romeo till I behold him- dead- With Tybalt &apos;s slander- Tybalt, that an hour With all the admired beauties of Verona. With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers. With blood remov &apos;d but little from her own? With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow &apos;d- With instruments upon them fit to open With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown With nimble soles;I have a soul of lead With open outcry, toward our monument. With piercing steel at bold Mercutio &apos;s breast;With purple fountains issuing from your veins! With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;With repetition of my Romeo &apos;s name. With speedy help doth lend redress.&apos;[Exit.] With tears augmenting the fresh morning &apos;s dew, With tender Juliet match &apos;d, is now not fair. With this night &apos;s revels and expire the term With thy black mantle till strange love, grown bold, With twenty hundred thousand times more joy With worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here Within the infant rind of this small flower Within this hour my man shall be with thee Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake. Within thy help and holy physic lies. Without a sudden calm will overset Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name;Women may fall when there &apos;s no strength in men. Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest! Would none but I might venge my cousin &apos;s death! Would through the airy region stream so bright &apos;Yea,&apos; quoth he, &apos;dost thou fall upon thy face? &apos;Yea,&apos; quoth my husband, &apos;fall &apos;st upon thy face? Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing. Yet most suspected, as the time and place Yet nature &apos;s tears are reason &apos;s merriment. Yet put it out, for I would not be seen. Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. You are a saucy boy. Is &apos;t so, indeed? You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so. You are welcome, gentlemen! Come, musicians, play. You must contrary me! Marry, &apos;tis time.- You tallow-face! You will set cock-a-hoop! you &apos;ll be the man! You &apos;ll make a mutiny among my guests! You &apos;ll not endure him? God shall mend my soul! You, Capulet, shall go along with me;You, to remove that siege of grief from her, Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim Young son, it argues a distempered head Your first is dead- or &apos;twere as good he were Your high displeasure. All this- uttered Your lady &apos;s love against some other maid Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
