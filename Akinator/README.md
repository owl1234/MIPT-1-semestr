This project is Akinator's likeness. He can speak thanks to Festival technology. Guide to his skills:

Akinator can guess the hidden word (the database is [here](https://github.com/owl1234/MIPT_projects_1_sem/blob/master/Akinator/database_pro.txt) (database_pro.txt), the picture is [here](https://github.com/owl1234/MIPT_projects_1_sem/blob/master/Akinator/picture.png) (picture.png))

He can also say the definition of a word (if, of course, he knows it. But he knows everything!)

If you don't want to think, but want to have some fun, enter the random command, and the megamind will display the definition of a random word.

Another skill is to compare words and find their similarities and differences.
