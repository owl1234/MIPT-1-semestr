Well, this repo is created for 1 semester study projects at MIPT. Below you can see the names of the projects and their small descriptions.

## [Quadratic equation solver](https://github.com/owl1234/MIPT_projects_1_sem/tree/master/Solve_square_equation)

This project deals with the solution of a quadratic equation. At the entrance to the program, 3 numbers are given, at the exit the user receives solutions. This work also has testing and documentation (doxygen).

## [Onegin](https://github.com/owl1234/MIPT_projects_1_sem/tree/master/Onegin)

## [Stack implementation](https://github.com/owl1234/MIPT_projects_1_sem/tree/master/Stack)

This project is a stack implementation. But it has more than just add, remove, etc. functions. It implements stack protection: hashing and canary protection.

## [CPU](https://github.com/owl1234/MIPT_projects_1_sem/tree/master/Freaky_CPU_on_defines)
It is a CPU emulator with a custom assembler language. A program written in this assembler is transformed to a binary “executable” which is executed by the CPU emulator.

## [List implementation](https://github.com/owl1234/MIPT_projects_1_sem/tree/master/List)

## [Decision tree](https://github.com/owl1234/MIPT_projects_1_sem/tree/master/Akinator)
Akinator's likeness. He can guess the object, compare two objects, name their similarities and differences, and much more (text voice acting works).

## [Differentiator](https://github.com/x-ENIAC/MIPT_projects_1_sem/tree/master/Differentiator)
The program that can differentiate any expression. Try it!

## [C-like language](https://github.com/x-ENIAC/MIPT_projects_1_sem/tree/master/Language)
C-like programming language written using its own [processor](https://github.com/owl1234/MIPT_projects_1_sem/tree/master/Freaky_CPU_on_defines).
