## [Quadratic equation solver](https://github.com/owl1234/MIPT_projects_1_sem/tree/master/Solve_square_equation)

This project deals with the solution of a quadratic equation. At the entrance to the program, 3 numbers are given, at the exit the user receives solutions. This work also has testing and documentation (doxygen).
