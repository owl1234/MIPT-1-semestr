# What is it?
This program sorts lines from the file. In this case, we are sorting the poem "Romeo and Juliet" by William Shakespeare. As a result, we get a file with 3 copys of poem. Firstly, text is sorted alphabetically from the beginning of the lines. Secondly, text is sorted alphabetically, tarting at the end of the lines. In the end we need to write original of the text in file.

# How do I start this?
Clone the repository to a folder. Run from command line. There are 3 options for the development of events:
1. If you want to view the help, write "-h"
2. If you want to sort something by file, write "-s input_file output_file", where input_file is the name of the file with the text you want to sort, output_file is the name of the file containing the sorting result.
3. If you want to test some of the functions used by the program, write "-t"
